      <p>Born two centuries ago, Ada Lovelace was a pioneer of computing science. She took part in writing the first published program and was a computing visionary, recognizing for the first time that computers could do much more than just calculations.

        <h3>Biography</h3>
        <div id="biography-div">
          <p>Ada Lovelace was born in London, England, UK on December 10, 1815. She was named Augusta Ada Byron.
Her father was the brilliant, yet notorious poet Lord Byron and her mother was Anne Isabella Milbanke. Her mother was highly intelligent, had been well-educated by private tutors, and was particularly enthusiastic about mathematics and the sciences. Ada’s father abandoned his wife and daughter, leaving Britain forever when Ada was one month old. He died in Greece when Ada was eight years old. Ada never knew him. </p>
<p>Ada’s mother, Lady Byron, seems to have had little or no affection for her daughter and had very little contact with her, but one thing she insisted upon was that Ada should get a high quality education.</p>

         <p>Growing up in a privileged aristocratic family, Lovelace was educated by home tutors, as was common for girls like her. She received lessons in French and Italian, music and in suitable handicrafts such as embroidery. Less common for a girl in her time, she also studied math. Lovelace continued to work with math tutors into her adult life, and she eventually corresponded with mathematician and logician Augustus De Morgan at London University about symbolic logic.

            Lovelace drew on all of these lessons when she wrote her computer program – in reality, it was a set of instructions for a mechanical calculator that had been built only in parts.

The computer in question was the Analytical Engine designed by mathematician, philosopher and inventor Charles Babbage. Lovelace had met Babbage when she was introduced to London society. The two related to each other over their shared love for mathematics and fascination for mechanical calculation. By the early 1840s, Babbage had won and lost government funding for a mathematical calculator, fallen out with the skilled craftsman building the precision parts for his machine, and was close to giving up on his project. At this point, Lovelace stepped in as an advocate.</p>
           <p> It was Ada Lovelace who first recognized the applications of the Analytical Engine, and indeed all early mechanical computers, as having applications beyond pure calculus. However, at this point — due in part to the capacity of computers at the time — Ada hadn’t entertained the notion of artificial intelligence.
Instead, Ada hypothesized that computers could be programmed to solve complex problems if given the correct input, representing more than just quantities or numbers. Essentially, Ada’s notes were the first theoretical description of the leap from calculation to general-purpose computation.</p>
<p>Inventing computer programming was not the first time Lovelace brought her knowledge from different areas to bear on a new subject. For example, as a young girl, she was fascinated with flying machines. Bringing together biology, mechanics and poetry, she asked her mother for anatomical books to study the function of bird wings. She built and experimented with wings, and in her letters, she metaphorically expressed her longing for her mother in the language of flying.
